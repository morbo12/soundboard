# Soundboard: A speaker/DJ helper app 

## Soundboard

Soundboard was written to support our "sekretariat" to play jingles during a match. It is explicitly targeting Innebandy (Floorball) in Stockholm, Sweden

Several extensions has been developed with the help of AI
- TTS (Text To Speech) - events that happens during the game can be read and played on the sound system, no need for a speaker person
- Display live reports of events during the game

The app is built primarily to Windows but is also build and tested on Android Phones. 

Features on both platforms
- Main soundboard
- TextToSpeech
- Theme changer

Features on Windows platform
- Lineups
- Live Events

## Limitations
- No plans exists to build for any Apple device.
- TTS requires an Azure Speech Service, which you need to provide yourself
- No jingles included

## Pre-req
Windows 10 needs a VC Redist update to run this program.
